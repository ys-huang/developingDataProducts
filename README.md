Developing data products from Coursera

## About the APP
* This simple app aims to provide a visual tool for showing result of k-means altorithm.
* You can assign two attributes from datasets as well as cluster number you prefer.
* Server will do the calculation based on the attributes and cluster number you choose, and show you the result on a 2-dimention plot.

## About the data: "User Knowledge Modeling Data Set "
It is the real dataset about the students' knowledge status about the subject of Electrical DC Machines. The dataset had been obtained from Ph.D. Thesis.

#### Attribute information
* STG (The degree of study time for goal object materails), (input value) 
* SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materails) (input value) 
* STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object) (input value) 
* LPR (The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object) (input value) 
* PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects) (input value) 
* UNS (The knowledge level of user) (target value)
